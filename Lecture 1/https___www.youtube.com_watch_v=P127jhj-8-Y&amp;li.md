This lecture provides a comprehensive introduction to transformers, covering their architecture, key components, and applications across AI domains. Here’s a structured breakdown with enhanced explanations and examples:

---

### **1. Core Components of Transformers**

#### **Self-Attention Mechanism**

- **Concept**: Allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other by computing weighted relationships.
    - **Example**: For the sentence *"The cat sat on the mat because it was tired"*, self-attention helps link "it" to "cat" by calculating high similarity scores between their query/key vectors.
    - **Equation**:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$
        - $Q, K, V$: Query, Key, Value matrices (learned via linear transformations of input embeddings).
        - $d_k$: Dimension of keys/queries (scaling prevents gradient vanishing).


#### **Multi-Head Attention**

- **Purpose**: Captures diverse relationships by running self-attention in parallel across multiple "heads".
    - **Example**:
        - *Head 1*: Focuses on syntactic roles (e.g., subject-verb agreement).
        - *Head 2*: Tracks semantic connections (e.g., "it" → "cat").
    - **Equation**:

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \dots, \text{head}_h)W^O
$$

where $\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)$.


#### **Positional Encoding**

- **Why?**: Unlike RNNs, transformers lack inherent sequence order awareness.
- **Method**: Adds sinusoidal or learned embeddings to input tokens.
    - **Example**: For position $pos$ and dimension $i$:

$$
PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right), \quad PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\left(\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)
$$
        - For $d=4$, position 1’s encoding: $[ \sin(1/100), \cos(1/100), \sin(1/10000), \cos(1/10000) ]$.

### **2. Encoder-Decoder Architecture**

#### **Encoder Block**

1. **Self-Attention Layer**: Computes context-aware representations.
2. **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: Adds non-linearity (e.g., ReLU).
3. **Layer Normalization \& Residual Connections**: Stabilizes training.

#### **Decoder Block**

- **Masked Self-Attention**: Prevents future token visibility (e.g., in GPT-3).
    - **Example**: When predicting the 3rd token in "I love ___", the decoder only uses tokens 1 and 2.
- **Cross-Attention**: Connects decoder to encoder outputs (used in translation tasks).

---

### **3. Advantages \& Limitations**

#### **Pros**

- **Parallelization**: Efficient GPU utilization vs. sequential RNNs.
- **Long-Range Context**: Constant path length between any two tokens (solves vanishing gradients in RNNs).


#### **Cons**

- **Quadratic Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ time/memory for sequence length $n$.
    - **Workarounds**: Sparse attention (e.g., BigBird), locality-sensitive hashing (Reformer).

---

### **4. Applications \& Examples**

#### **Natural Language Processing (GPT-3)**

- **Architecture**: Decoder-only transformer.
- **In-Context Learning**: Prompt with "Translate English to French: 'hello' → 'bonjour'. 'cat' → ___", model predicts "chat".


#### **Protein Folding (AlphaFold 2)**

- **Use Case**: Processes amino acid sequences with self-attention to predict 3D protein structures.


#### **Computer Vision (Vision Transformer)**

- **Method**: Splits images into patches, treats them as token sequences.

---

### **5. Practice Exercise**

**Task**: Compute self-attention for input embeddings:

- $X = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0.5 \\ 0.2 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix}$ (2 tokens, 2 dimensions).
- Learnable weights: $W^Q = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}$, $W^K = W^V = I$.

**Steps**:

1. Compute $Q = XW^Q = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0.5 \\ 0.2 &amp; 2 \end{bmatrix}$.
2. $K = X$, $V = X$.
3. Similarity scores: $QK^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1.25 &amp; 2.4 \\ 2.4 &amp; 4.04 \end{bmatrix}$.
4. Softmax: $\text{softmax}\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1.25 &amp; 2.4 \\ 2.4 &amp; 4.04 \end{bmatrix}\right)$.
5. Output: Weighted sum of $V$[^1].

### **Summary**

Transformers excel at capturing long-range dependencies via self-attention, enabling breakthroughs in NLP, CV, and biology. Key innovations include multi-head attention, positional encoding, and parallelization. For deeper understanding, implement a mini-transformer from scratch using PyTorch/TensorFlow and experiment with tasks like text summarization[^1].
